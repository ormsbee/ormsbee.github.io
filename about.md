> “When I first came here, this was all swamp. Everyone said I was daft to build
a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show them. It sank
into the swamp. So I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a
third. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one
stayed up. And that’s what you’re going to get, Lad, the strongest castle in all
of England.”

My name is David Ormsbee, and I'm a lead architect at edX. I thought I'd try to
blog about some of what I've been working on and thinking about. If you're here,
I hope you found something helpful (or at least mildly amusing).
